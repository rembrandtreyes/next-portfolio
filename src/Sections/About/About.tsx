        I am a front-end engineer creating things to be pixel-perfect. My career has given me the skills to design and
        develop things for the web. I have been focusing on what it means to give users the experience they deserve when
        they use our products
      </p>

        I live in sunny San Francisco with my wife and dog. We enjoy hiking, biking, and rock climbing. Whenever I have
        free time you can find me working on open source projects or working on side projects.
