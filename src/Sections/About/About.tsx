        Little bit about me
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am a front-end engineer creating websites to be responsive and pixel-perfect. My career has given me the
        skills needed to design and develop digital masterpieces. I have been focused on what it means to give users the
        experience they deserve when surfing the web.

      <p>
        I live in sunny San Francisco with my wife and dog. We enjoy hiking, biking, and rock climbing. Whenever I have
        free time you can find me working on open-source projects or personal projects.
