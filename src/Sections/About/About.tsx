        A front-end engineer crafting websites to be responsive and pixel-perfect. My career has given me the skills to
        design and develop digital masterpieces. I have been focused on what it means to give users the experience they
        deserve when surfing the web.

        I live in sunny San Francisco with my wife and dog. We enjoy hiking, biking, and rock climbing. Whenever I have
        free time you can find me working on open-source projects or personal projects.
